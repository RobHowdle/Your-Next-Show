Comprising of: Jonathan Jackson performing vocals, Josh Cameron on guitar, Chris Berry on bass and Will Thomas on drums. Sacrament's flawless technique of making it up as they go along has resulted in a sound that is both unique and diverse without sounding forced. 

Being influenced by many different metal genres and bands, Sacrament try to stay away from labels enabling them complete creative freedom to make sick music . Their music has been described to have an element of groove metal, being compared to bands such as  Lamb of God, Crowbar and Carcass, yet they still clearly have their own way of running things which is unmatched.",[],[],[],[],"{""spotify"":"""",""apple-music"":"""",""amazon-music"":"""",""soundcloud"":""https://on.soundcloud.com/WCMaVmpePczqG345A"",""youtube-music"":"""",""bandcamp"":""""}","[""original-bands""]",{},Josh Cameron,07708362200,sacramenttheband@gmail.com,"{""facebook"":""https://www.facebook.com/Sacramenttheband"",""instagram"":""https://www.instagram.com/sacrament_metal/"",""youtube"":""https://www.youtube.com/@Sacrament154""}",https://www.google.com,[],Artist

Wolfsmoke,https://linktothelogo.com/logo.png,"Sheffield, England, United Kingdom",Sheffield,-1.4702278,53.3806626,4,"Sheffield alternative rockers Wolfsmoke released stunning new single “DeadSpace”
on new years day 2025 on all streaming platforms.
Following their previous releases “Devils Cup”, “Fingertips” and “Come With Me” which were
recorded by Alex Quinn at Malice Recordings in the Yorkshire countryside. DeadSpace was
recorded at Hybrid 3 studios in Sheffield and released via their own label Howling Records. It
is the last recording to feature original drummer and founding member James Banks prior to
his departure from the band in June 2024.
The song penned by front woman Jo Nash, draws inspiration from personal feelings of being
trapped in a loveless relationship with no future and wanting more from life.
Featuring an eerie and solemn intro of vocals and clean guitar, it explodes into action with an
assault of drums, guitars and bass fuzz which drives the song through its catchy chorus and
riffs before it comes back down to finish just how it started.

Wolfsmoke have gone through a series of line up changes in 2024 bringing in new bassist
Scott Andrews and drummer Tara Armstrong and really upped their game with live
performances last year. New material which they are currently working on over the winter
will be debuted when they are back out on the road next year beginning with a showcase
event at Crank studios in Leeds on the 8th of March.",[],[],[],[],"{""spotify"":""https://open.spotify.com/track/3pTBxni7YadXaev4tbVLv7?referral=labelaffiliate&utm_source=1101lA8ebJuD&utm_medium=Indie_Routenote&utm_campaign=labelaffiliate"",""apple-music"":""https://music.apple.com/gb/album/deadspace/1782587141?i=1782587142"",""amazon-music"":""https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DP5RCTX3?tag=pushfm-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1"",""soundcloud"":""https://soundcloud.com/user-346539941-124297298/deadspace"",""youtube-music"":""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cktHybUwwOo&list=OLAK5uy_lqSJmv0VRLyV8qnr4omgysUi5XA03vfvY"",""bandcamp"":""https://wolfsmoke.bandcamp.com/track/deadspace""}","[""original-bands""]","{""Rock"": {""all"":""false"",""subgenres"":[""alternative_rock""]}}",Josh,00000000000,officialwolfsmoke@gmail.com,"{""facebook"":""https://www.facebook.com/wolfsmokeband"",""tiktok"":""https://www.tiktok.com/@Wolfsmokeband"",""youtube"":""https://www.youtube.com/@Wolfsmokeband"",""instagram"":""https://www.instagram.com/wolfsmokeband/""}",https://www.google.com,[],Artist
