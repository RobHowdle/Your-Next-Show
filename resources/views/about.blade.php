      <p class="mt-4 text-white">Your Next Show (YNS) is a custom-built music platform created by musicians for
        musicians. As a musician myself, I often struggled to find the right information when booking shows, whether it
        was reaching out to venues or promoters or ensuring they had everything they needed from me. The back-and-forth
        delays and miscommunication made the process unnecessarily stressful and frustrating.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-white">After researching existing platforms, I realized nothing truly catered to musicians.
        With my background as a developer, I decided to build something better. I started YNS in January 2024,
        dedicating my free time to the project and seeking input from artists, promoters, and venues to create something
        the community truly needs.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-white">I’ve personally gathered and carefully organized all the data on this platform to ensure
        its accuracy and integrity. It was essential to me that musicians could rely on the information they’re
        receiving. Additionally, I’ve made the conscious decision to keep YNS free of costs and advertisements, because
        I believe that vital information shouldn't come with a price tag. Ads, in particular, often disrupt the
        experience, and I wanted to create a clean, user-friendly space where musicians can focus on what really
        matters: connecting with the right people and opportunities.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-white">Originally envisioned as a simple search tool for venues, YNS quickly evolved into
        something much bigger. Now, it offers features like filtering by genre, band type, and more. The platform also
        supports a variety of roles, including venue owners, promoters, designers, photographers, and videographers,
        with plans to expand even further.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-white">Tailored dashboards are a core part of YNS. Whether you're a musician tracking shows
        you've attended or a professional managing your business, the platform has you covered. Features include
        uploading EPKs and terms, managing budgets and finance records, and generating detailed reports you can export
        over days, weeks, or even years.</p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-white">YNS is continuously improving, with regular updates, bug fixes, and exciting new
        features planned for the future.</p>
